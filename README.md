### SportsTracker Application

The SportsTracker application is a simple Java program designed to help users log and track the time spent on various sports activities throughout the week. The application provides a command-line interface with the following features:

1. **Log Activity**: Users can log a new sports activity by entering the activity name and the duration in minutes.
2. **View Activities**: Users can view a list of all logged activities along with their durations.
3. **Calculate Total Time**: Users can calculate the total time spent on all logged sports activities for the week.
4. **Exit**: Users can exit the application.

The application uses a list to store the logged activities and provides methods to handle user input and display the required information. The main class, `SportsTracker`, contains the logic for these operations.
